## Install
  
```
$ npm install --save pick-weight 
```
  
## Usage
  
```js
var weighted = require('pick-weight');
  
// API
// - weighted(arr, weights);
```

The following code will generate `'a'` 100 times more often than `'b'` but still choose one or the other randomly.
  
```js
weighted(['a', 'b'], [100, 1]);
// => 'a'
```

The weights are all relative, so if you have more than just two it will ensure that all items are generated relative to all of the weights.

```js
weighted(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], [1, 2, 3, 4]);
// => 'c'
```

Will generate a letter from the array but will pick `'b'` twice as often as it picks `'a'` and will pick `'c'` three times as often as it picks `'a'` and will pick `'d'` four times as often as it will pick `'a'` and will pick `'d'` two times as often as it will pick `'b'`.  

The weights can be whole numbers as shown above or fractions.

```js
weighted(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]);
// => 'd'
```

There is no requirement that the weights sum to anything in particular, they are all compared relative to each other so all of the following are equivalent:

```js
weighted(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], [1, 2, 3, 4]);
weighted(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]);
weighted(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], [100, 200, 300, 400]);
weighted(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], [17, 34, 51, 68]);
weighted(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], [0.17, 0.34, 0.51, 0.68]);
```
